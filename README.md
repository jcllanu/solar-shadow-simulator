# 🌞 Solar Shadow Simulator

Simulates the sun’s position and shadow evolution on Earth based on date, time, and location. Generates animations, sunrise/sunset times, and solar trajectory plots across latitudes and seasons using basic astronomical geometry.

---

## 📌 Overview

This Python project models the **sun’s path** and the **shadows it casts** using spherical geometry and simplified orbital mechanics. It supports:

- Shadow trajectory simulations over a day or year
- Sunrise/sunset time computation
- Animated visualizations across latitudes and key solar dates
- Solar event markers (equinoxes, solstices)

---

## 🌐 Coordinate System and Geometry

- 🌍 Earth's daily rotation is calculated around its **tilted axis**
- ☀️ Sun’s position calculated using basic orbital dynamics
- 🧭 Shadows projected on a local East-North plane
- 🧮 Uses 3D spherical and cartesian coordinate transformations

---

## 🖥️ How to Use

Run the main script and choose a mode:
1.- Shadow evolution for solstices, equinoxes, and in-between days across latitudes
2.- Shadow evolution for a specific date and location
3.- Yearly shadow evolution across latitudes at fixed hours
4.- Yearly shadow evolution for a specific location and fixed time
5.- Sunrise and sunset chart over the year for a given latitude
6.- Sunrise and sunset time for a given day and latitude
